# The Sis50 House Site!

This is the repo for the site of the house Simonsstraat 50 in the Netherlands.

It is mainly a website that allows us to easily centralise some important tasks that have to be done. Right now progress is not perfect, and the only basic things implemented as of right now are:

- Table for Attendance, this basically determines who is cooking when, and for who.
- Community shopping list, this contains house items, that are kind of needed, and should be gotten by anyone who goes shopping

## Items that will be added

- A basic notice board
- A small mini game (preferably also playable on phone)
- XKCD comic of the day... yes... don't judge.

... and a small easter egg.

So yes... we got a website. :>
